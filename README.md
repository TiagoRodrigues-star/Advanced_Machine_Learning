## First Assignment - Neural Networks
This assignment focused on understanding the backpropagation algorithm and the implementation of a Neural Network with distinct activation functions and momentum values.

### Models used:
- Neural Networks

### Problems:
The problems were adapted from [Neural Networks and Learning Machines](https://books.google.pt/books/about/Neural_Networks_and_Learning_Machines.html?id=KCwWOAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y). The problems proposed were adapted from problem 4.1 and 4.2 of the book.

### Assignment Objectives:
- First exercise:
  - Determine separation planes of the proposed Neural Network
  - Obtain truth table
  - Consider a sigmoid activation function and calculate 1 iteration of the error backpropagation algorithm
- Second exercise:
  - Implement the Neural Network proposed and test different activation functions and momentum values
  - Implement the Neural Network of the first exercise and compare results


## Second Assignment - Support Vector Machines
This assignment focused on understanding the effect of support vectors, the optimization of the SVMs parameters and data transformation to obtain linear separation of data. 

### Models used:
- Support Vector Machines (Kernels: linear, poly, sigmoid and rbf)

### Problems:
The problems were adapted from [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/understaing-support-vector-machine-example-code/). The first problem focused on studying the effect of support vectors on the decision boundary; the second focused on tunning the SVM parameters and the third on data transformation to obtain linear separation of data.

### Data:
The data used was the well known [Iris Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html).

### Assignment Objectives:
- First exercise:
  - Train a poly SVM on the dataset
  - Remove some support vectors and evaluate how it affects the decision boundary
- Second exercise:
  - Optimize the hyparameters of the SVM
- Third exercise:
  - Find a data transformation that leads to a linear separable problem
  - Visualize data in 3D using the extra feature from the data transformation
  - Use different kernels and evaluate which one leads to better performance on the original dataset
